# Tableau Project: YouTube Data Analysis (US)

This repository contains a Tableau project titled "YouTube Data Analysis (US)" as part of the Udacity Data Analysis course. The project focuses on analyzing YouTube data from the United States using Tableau.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have explored and visualized a dataset containing YouTube video statistics and attributes for videos from the US. By utilizing Tableau, I have created insightful visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of YouTube video data from the United States. It includes various attributes such as video title, channel name, view count, likes, dislikes, comment count, and others. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the YouTube landscape, allowing for meaningful analysis and visualization.

## Tableau Visualizations

The Tableau project includes a set of interactive visualizations that provide valuable insights into the YouTube data. Some of the key visualizations and analyses performed in this project are:

1. **Top Channels by Views**: A visualization showcasing the top YouTube channels based on the total number of views they have accumulated.
2. **Likes vs. Dislikes**: A comparison of likes and dislikes for videos, highlighting the engagement and sentiment of viewers.
3. **View Count Distribution**: A histogram depicting the distribution of video view counts, providing an understanding of popular and less popular videos.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Exploration of the correlation between various video attributes such as views, likes, dislikes, and comment count.
5. **Video Categories**: An analysis of video categories, identifying the most popular genres on YouTube.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `/data`: This folder contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- `/visualizations`: This folder holds the Tableau project file and exported visualizations as images.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

To explore the Tableau project and visualize the YouTube data analysis:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.
3. Import the Tableau project file (`.twbx`) located in the `/visualizations` folder.
4. Interact with the visualizations to gain insights into the YouTube data.
